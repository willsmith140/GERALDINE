# GERALDINE (Google earth Engine supRaglAciaL Debris INput dEtector)

As glacial environments deglaciate, debris supply rates increase, expanding supraglacial debris cover, and influencing glacial dynamics. The largest debris inputs (landslides and rock avalanches) can be identified using their acoustic signature, but seismic methods are limited to events with magnitudes M â‰¥ 5.0, and only locate to within a 20 - 100 km radius. Here, we present GERALDINE; a new tool that identifies large new supraglacial debris additions within user-defined areas and time ranges using the vast collection of Landsat 4-8 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine. We demonstrate its potential by identifying two previously unknown, large (>2 km2) supraglacial debris inputs onto glaciers in the Hayes Range, Alaska, one of which was not detected acoustically. The number of such large-scale supraglacial landslides is likely underestimated, particularly in deglaciating high mountain regions.
